<p>
This is my final project in "3D Animation with Unreal Engine 4" project. 
In this project I created a game called "Secret agent training simulator".</p>

game description: 
"Join the secret agent training program to become an official agent!  You must successfully complete three missions which will test your agility, intelligence and quick thinking. Be warned, failing a mission will not be accepted and you will need to re-do it in order to pass the program!"

 game walkthrough video is added as a file to this project.
